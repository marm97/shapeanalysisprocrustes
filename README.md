Hippocampus Shape Analysis

By means of procrustes analysis the main objective of the present project is to compare hippocampus shapes in order to asses possible damages. We base our idea on the fact that when the structuring elements are aligned, it is easier to compare them because differences from orientation are bypassed. In order to implement this algorithm, processes of separation, dierentiation, rotation and translation have been applied. These procedures pretend to obtain the most accurate alignment for comparison purposes. There has been success in the alignment of almost all of the meshes. This has enabled us to see some main dierences bewteen
hippocampus because some regions were unaligned due to morphological disorders in most of the cases.
